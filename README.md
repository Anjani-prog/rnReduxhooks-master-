## React native Redux

Redux is a state management tool for JavaScript applications.

Entire state of an application is stored in one central location, called the store.

Meaning that each component of your React app gets to have direct access to the state of the application without having to send props down to a child component or using callback functions to send data back up to a parent! And that’s pretty dreamy.
Redux provides a central store that can hold data from ANYWHERE in the application.
To put it differently, Redux completely eliminates this messy tunneling that can happen when you’re passing data from a parent down to many different subcomponents and manipulating it in all those places.
